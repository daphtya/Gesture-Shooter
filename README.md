# Gesture-Shooter
A simple shooter game controlled with hand gestures, using openCV python

## Contents
The bin folder contains the compiled version that should work without opencv installed.
The src folder contains the source code. It's still a rough code that might be hard to read. I might make it more modular in the future.

## How to run
Run the exe file in the bin folder or the python file in the src folder. If you want to use the source code, make sure you have a python 3 with OpenCV library installed.

I recommend you to play in a well-lit room with clean backgrounds.

## How to play
When you run the program, two windows will appear. One for the game and one for the hand gesture recognition. You should avoid making any movements inside the green square in the hand gesture window when the program just started.

Then, an enemy should start appearing from above in the game window. Put your hand in the green square to control the spaceship below. You can use the following gestures:
1. Point with one finger to shoot normal shots in that direction
2. Spread your fingers to make slow spread shots
3. Make a knuckle to make quick shots to the left and right
